# Question 2 Component Readme

The `Question_2` component is a React component designed to illustrate the behavior of asynchronous code execution and state management in a React application. The main focus is on understanding how the interaction between asynchronous data fetching and state updates influences the rendering process. The component presents a question regarding the expected outcome and provides multiple options for consideration.

## Question

The `Question_2` component presents the following question:

"What will be displayed in the browser?"

### Options

1. A "correct" message will be displayed.
2. `setState` is never called.
3. A 'not correct' message will be displayed.
4. The code results in a memory leak.

## Behavior Explanation

The `Question_2` component includes a function called `fetchData`, which returns a Promise that resolves with the current timestamp after a 100-millisecond delay. Within the component, the `useState` hook manages the `state` variable. The component initiates an asynchronous data fetching operation using the `fetchData` function.

The content displayed in the browser depends on the comparison between `data.toString()` and `state`. If these two values match, a 'correct' message is displayed; otherwise, a 'not correct' message is shown.

## Expected Outcome

Given the asynchronous nature of the `fetchData` function and the delayed assignment of the `data` variable, the correct answer is:

**Option 3**: A 'not correct' message will be displayed.

Due to the asynchronous assignment of `data` using a promise, there is a delay that affects the comparison with the `state` variable during rendering. As a result, the comparison is unlikely to evaluate as true, leading to the display of the 'not correct' message.
