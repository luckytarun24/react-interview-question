# Question 9 Component Readme

The `Question_9` component aims to determine the value of the `message` variable when the component is first rendered. The component includes an input element with a default value and an `onChange` event handler that updates the `message` state based on the input value. The goal is to identify the initial value of the `message` variable.

## Question

The `Question_9` component presents the following question:

"What will be the value of the variable `message` when the component is first rendered?"

### Options

- **Option 1**: `undefined`
- **Option 2**: An empty string
- **Option 3**: `"hello"`
- **Option 4**: `"e.target.value"`

## Explanation

The `Question_9` component includes an input element with a `defaultValue` of `"hello"` and an `onChange` event handler that updates the `message` state using the `e.target.value` property.

The `message` state is managed using the `useState` hook, but it doesn't have an initial value provided. In React, when a state variable is initialized without a value, its initial value is `undefined`.

## Expected Outcome

Based on the provided code, the correct answer is **Option 1**: `undefined`.

When the `Question_9` component is first rendered, the `message` state is initialized without an initial value, so its value is `undefined`. The `console.log` statement will display `message value undefined` in the console.
